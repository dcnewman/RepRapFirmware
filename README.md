This repository is a fork of [dc42's fork of the
RepRapFirmware](https://github.com/dc42/RepRapFirmware) but with
additions to build using the scons command line tool rather than
the Eclipse IDE.  See the file `INSTALL.md` for instructions on
how to build this RepRapFirmware fork for RADDS v1.5 electronics.
